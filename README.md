# SPACE-TRAVELLER
MY MINI PROJECT DEVLOPED USING PYGAME


I'VE RECENTLY ATTEN AN ONLINE EVENT WHERE I LEARNT SOME BASICS OF PYGAME 

SO TO TEST MY SKILL I DEVELOPED AN ENTRY LEVEL SPACE GAME.

USE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW KEYS FOR MOVING YOUR ROCKET. AND TRY TO ESCAPE FRO THE ASTROIDS.

I DIDN'T SET ANY FINISHING FOR MY GAME SO PLAY AS LONG AS YOU CAN AND TRY TO SET AN HIGH SCORE.

HAVE FUN!!!
